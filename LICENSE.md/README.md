Code of Conduct – Whatcom IT Professional Meetup
Purpose
Whatcom IT Professionals meetup group is geared towards local business IT professionals to grow, share and explore the technical side of the business while maintaining a social atmosphere between established and new people of the industry. Topics will range from Networking, Servers, Documentation, Programming, Web Development and Customer Relations. Other minor topics may include trending IT related news within the industry.
Whatcom IT Professionals strives in appealing to the largest number of contributors as possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of their professional or personal background including education, experience, age, ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, physical appearance, or religion. We invite all those who participate in Whatcom IT Professionals to help us in creating such an environment.
This Code of Conduct (CoC) outlines the expectations of all who participate in our group, as well as how we should respond to unacceptable behavior. We expect participants will abide by this CoC in all community venues—whether online or in-person—as well as in one-on-one communications as they pertain to group business.
Expectations
You are expected to:
•	Behave professionally.
•	Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
•	Attempt collaboration before conflict.
•	Refrain from any unacceptable behavior.
Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our meetup group. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.
Our expectation is that we will treat each other, and others our community interacts with, with consideration, empathy, and respect. Our speech and behavior will be guided by a desire to create and maintain an inclusive community purposed towards sharing knowledge and encouraging enthusiasm for solving problems with APIs.
Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
Complaints
It is every community member's responsibility to notice, and attempt to intervene or notify others, if unacceptable behaviors are occurring at a meeting or event.
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. You can contact the organizers through direct messages via the meetup platform, or email personally at austin@plainenglishtechnology.com. 
The current organizers are:

If you have a complaint that involves an organizer, you can contact one of the others in confidence. The group is the priority, and steps will be taken to ensure the group is successful.
Mailing List Etiquette
In addition to adhering to the CoC, we ask that you also adhere to the following guidelines as they pertain to the mailing list.

•	Stay on topic and post constructive messages.
•	Remember that your emails are sent to all subscribers and that they are archived and made publicly available on the meetup.com website.
•	Avoid sending large attachments.
•	Do not quote messages that were sent to you by other people in private mail, unless agreed beforehand.
